    <h1>KITCHEN REMODEL</h1>

  <div class="aboutremodel">
    <p>
      The explosion of remodeling shows on TV and makeover spreads in magazines has whetted America’s appetite for glamorous rooms brimming with the latest furnishings, appliances and color schemes.

Kitchen remodels are among the most popular, according to a report in the just-published August issue of Consumer Reports and online at consumerreports.org. And the economic slowdown means there are outstanding deals on everything from cooktops to countertops.
It also means kitchen designers and building contractors are eager for work and willing to negotiate.

      When planning a remodel, determining your budget is one of the first steps. The National Kitchen Bath Association calculates the average kitchen remodel costs between 10 percent and 20 percent of the home’s value. But obviously, the extent of the makeover determines its cost.
      In its latest issue, Consumer Reports takes top-performing products and creates three design schemes: a do-it-yourself makeover for $5,000; a plan that costs $15,000 (the average spent on a kitchen remodel); and a full-scale renovation for $50,000.

  Determining your priorities is another key step, said Phil Johnson, a partner at Spence Vaughn and a certified kitchen designer.

  “Do you love to cook? If so, now might be the time to consider professional-style appliances,” he said. “Do you have a large family? Consider how best to accommodate them in your new space. Think about the things you love in your old kitchen — and the things you dislike.”

  In addition, Johnson recommends the following steps for a successful remodel:


  — Do your homework. Watch TV remodeling programs, clip appealing pictures and articles from magazines, attend remodeling seminars, visit home shows and parades of homes. Consult with a kitchen designer who is a member of the NKBA, who has the training and experience to avoid many of the things that can go wrong with a remodeling project.
